## Getting Started

To get started with CreoBank, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

3. Build and run the app on the simulator or a connected device.

## Architecture

The CreoBank app follows the [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel) architectural pattern. It separates the user interface (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and data handling (Model).

- **View**: Responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the user.
- **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic and provides data to the View.
- **Model**: Represents the data and interacts with external services (e.g., API requests, data persistence).
